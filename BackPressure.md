# ðŸ§  Backpressure in System Design

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Backpressure?

**Backpressure** is a **flow control mechanism** used in systems where data is produced faster than it can be consumed. It prevents system overload by **signaling the producer to slow down** or pause data transmission when the consumer is overwhelmed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Where It's Used

- **Streaming systems** (e.g., Kafka, Flink, Apache Storm)
- **Message queues** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- **Reactive programming** (e.g., RxJava, Project Reactor)
- **Microservices** (via HTTP, messaging, gRPC, etc.)
- **Operating systems** (TCP flow control)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Backpressure is Important

Without backpressure:

- Buffers overflow
- System crashes or drops messages
- High latency due to queue buildup
- Poor user experience

With backpressure:

- Smooth flow of data
- Maintains stability and reliability
- Protects downstream services

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy

> Think of a conveyor belt in a factory. If workers at the end can't process items fast enough, the belt will overflow unless the machine feeding it slows down â€” this slowing down is **backpressure**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It's Implemented

1. **Pull-based models**
   - The consumer requests data only when ready.
   - Example: Reactive Streams (`Publisher` â†’ `Subscriber` with `request(n)`)

2. **Acknowledgments (ACKs)**
   - The producer waits for ACK before sending more.
   - Used in messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka

3. **Buffer limits**
   - When buffer size is hit, producers are blocked or throttled.

4. **Rate limiting**
   - Producers are restricted to fixed data rates.

5. **Circuit breakers**
   - Temporarily reject new requests when the system is overwhelmed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example in Microservices

If **Service A** calls **Service B** rapidly but B is slow, then:

- Service B's threads/queue may fill up.
- It sends backpressure signals (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`, or gRPC backpressure).
- Service A can retry later or slow down its request rate.

## ðŸ”¹ In Reactive Systems (Java)

Using **Project Reactor** (Spring WebFlux):

```java
Flux.range(1, 100)
    .onBackpressureBuffer()
    .subscribe(new BaseSubscriber<Integer>() {
        protected void hookOnNext(Integer value) {
            request(1); // controls flow manually
        }
    });
