# 🧱 Monolithic Architecture

## ✅ What is a Monolith?

A **Monolith** is a software architecture where the **entire application is built as a single, unified unit**.  
All features—UI, business logic, and data access—are packaged together and deployed as one application.

> In a monolith, all components are tightly coupled and run in the same process.

---

## 🧰 Example

A Java Spring Boot application where:
- Controllers, Services, Repositories
- Authentication, Payments, Orders, Notifications

...are all in the same codebase and deployed as a single `.jar` or `.war` file.

---

## 🧠 Characteristics

- Single codebase and shared database
- Deployed as one unit
- Tightly coupled modules
- Typically simpler for small teams or projects

## ✅ Advantages

| Benefit             | Description                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛠 Simpler Development | Easy to build and test locally                                 |
| 🚀 Faster Deployment  | One-click or CI/CD push deploys the whole app                 |
| 🧩 Easier Debugging    | Logs and errors all in one place                              |
| 📦 Centralized Config | Easier to manage one config set and shared code               |

## ❌ Disadvantages

| Limitation             | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ Scalability Issues     | Cannot scale modules independently (e.g., payments vs auth)     |
| 🔄 Slow Deployment        | One small change redeploys the whole app                       |
| 🚧 Hard to Maintain       | Becomes complex and fragile as the codebase grows              |
| 🧪 Low Fault Isolation    | One bug can bring down the entire application                  |
| 👥 Team Bottlenecks       | Hard for multiple teams to work on the same codebase safely     |

## 🆚 Monolith vs Microservices

| Aspect         | Monolith                         | Microservices                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Deployment     | Single unit                      | Independent units                  |
| Scalability    | Whole app                        | Per service                        |
| Team Ownership | Shared                           | Separate teams                     |
| Communication  | Internal method calls            | Network calls (HTTP/gRPC)          |
| Fault Isolation| Poor                             | Strong                             |

## 🚀 When to Use Monolithic Architecture

- ✅ Small team or startup
- ✅ MVP or early-stage product
- ✅ Simple business logic
- ✅ No need for independent scaling

---

## ❌ When to Avoid Monoliths

- ❌ Large codebase with multiple teams
- ❌ Need for independent scaling and deployment
- ❌ High availability or fault-tolerance required
- ❌ Rapid feature releases across modules

---

## 📌 Summary

> A **monolithic architecture** is simple to start with but can become a bottleneck as the system scales.  
Many companies **start with a monolith** and later **migrate to microservices** as complexity grows.
