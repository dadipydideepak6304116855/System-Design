# 📬 Message Queues

Message queues are an essential component of distributed systems that enable asynchronous communication between different parts of a system, often between microservices.

## 🧠 What is a Message Queue?

A **message queue** is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication. It allows producers to send messages that are stored temporarily and then consumed by consumers in the order they arrive (FIFO - First In, First Out).

### 🔁 How It Works:

1. **Producer** sends a message.
2. **Message Queue** stores the message temporarily.
3. **Consumer** retrieves the message and processes it.
4. Messages are removed after being processed.

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Message Queues

- **Decoupling**: Services are independent and communicate via messages.
- **Scalability**: Handle high load by scaling consumers.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background jobs or time-consuming tasks.
- **Reliability**: Messages are persisted and retried in case of failure.
- **Load Balancing**: Evenly distribute workload among multiple consumers.

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases

- Task queues (e.g., sending emails, processing images)
- Event-driven architecture
- Logging systems
- Order processing systems
- Microservice communication

## ⚙️ Message Queue Terminology

| Term            | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Producer**    | Component that sends messages |
| **Consumer**    | Component that receives messages |
| **Broker**      | Middleware that stores and routes messages (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) |
| **Queue**       | Data structure storing messages |
| **Topic**       | (Pub/Sub model) Named stream of messages |
| **Publisher**   | Sends messages to a topic |
| **Subscriber**  | Listens for messages from a topic |
| **Acknowledgement (ACK)** | Signal that a message has been successfully processed |

## 🧱 Queue Types

### 1. **Point-to-Point (Queue-Based)**  
- One producer, one or many consumers  
- Each message is processed by **only one consumer**  

### 2. **Publish/Subscribe (Topic-Based)**  
- Messages are broadcast to all subscribers  
- Ideal for event-driven architectures  

---

## 🔒 Reliability Features

- **Message Durability**: Ensures messages survive crashes (e.g., Kafka’s disk log).
- **Acknowledgements (ACK/NACK)**: Ensures successful processing or retries.
- **Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)**: Holds messages that failed to be processed.
