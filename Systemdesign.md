📘 What is System Design?
System Design refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a critical step in software development, especially for scalable, maintainable, and performant systems.

🔧 Why is System Design Important?
✅ Ensures scalability to handle growth in users and data

✅ Supports reliability and availability of services

✅ Promotes maintainability and modular development

✅ Improves performance, latency, and user experience

✅ Encourages security and fault tolerance

🧠 Key Concepts in System Design
Concept	Description
Scalability	Ability to handle increased load by scaling horizontally or vertically.
Load Balancing	Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
Caching	Stores frequently accessed data for faster response times.
Database Design	Choosing SQL vs NoSQL, indexing, sharding, replication.
Asynchronous Processing	Decouples components for better responsiveness (queues, pub-sub).
Failover & Redundancy	Ensures service continuity during failures.
CDN	Delivers content from servers closer to the user to reduce latency.
API Design	REST, GraphQL, gRPC – consistent, well-documented interfaces.

🧱 Types of System Design
High-Level Design (HLD): Overall architecture, technologies, services, protocols.

Low-Level Design (LLD): Detailed class-level diagrams, database schema, APIs.

🧑‍💻 Common Tools/Technologies
Load Balancer (Nginx, HAProxy)

Caching (Redis, Memcached)

Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra)

Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

API Gateways (Kong, Zuul)

Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

🏁 Summary
System Design is not about coding, but about thinking — how systems interact, how to break them into components, and how to ensure performance, scalability, and reliability at scale.
