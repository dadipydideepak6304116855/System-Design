## 🔹 What is Data Federation?

**Data Federation** is a technique that allows you to **access and query data from multiple sources** (databases, APIs, services) as if they were a **single unified data source**, without physically moving or duplicating the data.

> 📌 Think of it as creating a **virtual database layer** on top of multiple heterogeneous data sources.

## 🔹 Why Use Data Federation?

- ✅ Unified access to distributed data
- ✅ No need for ETL or data duplication
- ✅ Real-time or near real-time querying
- ✅ Simplifies reporting and analytics
- ✅ Reduces integration complexity

## 🔹 Real-World Analogy

> Imagine a **library catalog** that shows books from many different libraries. You can search one interface, even though the books are stored in different physical locations. That’s data federation.

## 🔹 How It Works

```plaintext
[Client Query]
      ↓
[Data Federation Layer]
      ↓
[Data Source A]      [Data Source B]      [API C]
      ↓                  ↓                  ↓
    Merge and transform → Unified Response → Client
