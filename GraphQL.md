# ðŸ§® GraphQL in System Design

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is a **query language** and **runtime** for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need â€” no more, no less.

> ðŸ“Œ Developed by Facebook, GraphQL offers a **flexible and efficient alternative to REST**, especially for modern frontend-backend interactions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use GraphQL?

- âœ… Fetch only the required data (no over-fetching or under-fetching)
- âœ… Single endpoint for all queries and mutations
- âœ… Strongly typed schema
- âœ… Self-documenting API
- âœ… Ideal for mobile/web apps with varied data needs

## ðŸ”¹ GraphQL vs REST

| Feature              | REST                         | GraphQL                             |
|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**     | Fixed response structure      | Flexible queries (fetch only needed) |
| **Endpoints**         | Multiple endpoints            | Single endpoint                      |
| **Over-fetching**     | Common                        | Avoided                              |
| **Under-fetching**    | Common (requires extra calls) | Avoided                              |
| **Versioning**        | Handled via URL (v1, v2, etc.)| Not required (evolves via schema)    |
| **Tooling**           | Postman, Swagger              | GraphiQL, Apollo, Relay              |
