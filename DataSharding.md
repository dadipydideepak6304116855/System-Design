## ðŸ”¹ What is Data Sharding?

**Data Sharding** is a **database partitioning technique** where large datasets are split into **smaller, more manageable pieces called "shards"**, and each shard is stored separately (often on different servers or nodes).

> ðŸ“Œ The goal is to **improve performance, scalability, and availability** by distributing the data horizontally.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Use Sharding?

- âœ… Handles **large-scale data volumes**
- âœ… Improves **query performance** and **latency**
- âœ… Enables **horizontal scaling**
- âœ… Reduces **storage and compute bottlenecks**
- âœ… Isolates failures to specific shards

## ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy

> ðŸ“š Think of a library where books are organized alphabetically across different rooms. If all books were in one room, finding one would be slow. Splitting by category (sharding) makes the search faster.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Sharding

### 1. Horizontal Sharding

- Split **rows** of a table across different shards
- Each shard contains a subset of the data

```plaintext
User Table
------------
Shard 1 â†’ Users with ID 1â€“10000
Shard 2 â†’ Users with ID 10001â€“20000


2. Vertical Sharding
Split columns or tables by functionality

Each shard handles specific features/modules

Shard 1 â†’ User Profiles Table  
Shard 2 â†’ Orders Table  
Shard 3 â†’ Payments Table

3. Geographic / Regional Sharding
Shard data based on geography

plaintext

US Users   â†’ US Shard  
EU Users   â†’ EU Shard  
APAC Users â†’ APAC Shard


ðŸ”¹ Sharding Key
A sharding key determines how data is distributed across shards.

Examples:

user_id

tenant_id

region

email (hashed)
