# 📐 What is HLD (High-Level Design)?

**High-Level Design (HLD)** is the abstract architecture of a system. It outlines the overall structure, major components, and their interactions without diving into the details of implementation.

---

## 🧠 Purpose of HLD

- To provide a **bird's eye view** of the entire system.
- Acts as a **bridge between requirements and Low-Level Design (LLD)**.
- Helps stakeholders understand the **architecture, flow, and technology stack**.
- Guides the development and testing teams with **component-level understanding**.

## 🧱 What Does HLD Include?

- 🔹 **System architecture diagram**  
- 🔹 **Modules and components**  
- 🔹 **Data flow between components**  
- 🔹 **Technology stack used**  
- 🔹 **External integrations/APIs**  
- 🔹 **Database selection and structure (at high level)**  
- 🔹 **Security considerations (e.g., auth, encryption)**  
- 🔹 **Scalability and fault tolerance strategy**

## 📊 Example: HLD for a YouTube-like Platform

- **Frontend**: ReactJS web app
- **Backend**: Microservices – Auth Service, Video Service, Comment Service
- **Database**: MongoDB (for comments), MySQL (for users)
- **CDN**: For video delivery
- **Queue**: Kafka for processing uploads

> 📘 HLD is **not about coding** – it’s about **architecting** the solution before it’s built.
